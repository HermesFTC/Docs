# Hermes
![Maven Central Version](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/me.zharel.hermes/core?label=latest%20release&labelColor=darkBlue&color=yellow)

Hermes offers a revolutionary motion profiling and planning
algorithm that builds on RoadRunner from ACME Robotics,
FTC Team 8367. 

## Features
- **Path Planning** with smooth continuity, such as BÃ©zier curves,
  hermite splines, and more! 
- **Motion Profiling** paths to ensure the most optimal
  trajectory for your robot, using either time or displacement
- **Action Framework** for easily scalable robot actions
  for asynchronous robot control
- **Advanced Following** that uses PID control and 
  voltage-compensated feedforward to accurately follow
  trajectories
- **Unparalleled Customization** in path generation, 
  profiling, and following

## QuickStart

We recommend using the [QuickStart](https://github.com/HermesFTC/Quickstart),
as it already has `Localizer`, `Drive`, and `Follower` implementations, 
the required tuning OpMode setup, and some convenient examples!

## Adding To An Existing Project

If you are installing Hermes to an existing project, 
we recommend downloading the QuickStart and copying *its* 
`TeamCode` module package to the `TeamCode` module in your project. 

You will also need to add the library as a dependency in your Gradle scripts.
In your `build.dependencies.gradle` file, add the following three lines
to the `dependencies` block:

```groovy
    implementation 'me.zharel.hermes:core:<latest>>'
    implementation 'me.zharel.hermes:actions:<latest>'
    implementation 'me.zharel.hermes:ftc:<latest>'
```

Where `latest` is replaced by the latest version as displayed above.

Then, sync your project with Gradle files.

## Updating From RoadRunner 1.0

Hermes's API is mostly compatible with RoadRunner code,
though package locations were changed.
Simply replace your RoadRunner imports with the following:

```groovy
    implementation 'me.zharel.hermes:core:<latest>>'
    implementation 'me.zharel.hermes:actions:<latest>'
    implementation 'me.zharel.hermes:ftc:<latest>'
```

And sync your project with Gradle files. 

!!! Warning
    You will need to remove all of the RoadRunner imports from your files
    and replace them with Hermes's.
    Once you delete the import statements, IntelliJ and Android Studio
    can automatically replace them.

## Tuning 

If you are using the QuickStart, the tuning process is
the exact same as the [RoadRunner 1.0 tuning process](https://rr.brott.dev/docs/v1-0/tuning/).
Future changes to the tuning process will be listed here.

## KDoc 

[KDoc for Hermes can be found here](https://docs.hermes.zharel.gay/).
We recommend checking the KDoc pages, 
as they include many features not directly discussed here.
